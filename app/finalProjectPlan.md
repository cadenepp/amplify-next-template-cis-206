# Final Project CIS 206

### Writen Descripton
I want to make my personal project based on a stock selector to where you can search a stock and get back important information related to swing trading. There will be a home page with a small introduction to the application then you can only use the service once you sign in or make an account using there email and password. On home page before you login there wil be an about page explaining why I'm making this and what its for in more depth.
